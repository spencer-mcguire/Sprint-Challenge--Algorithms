#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) because it is linear.

b) O(n^2) becuase the operations are the square of the input size as such with nested loops.

c) O(n) because it recursively moves towards the base case.

## Exercise II

Write a function that takes in `n` as stories and outputs `f` as the floor where eggs begin to break

I need to check at which point in n stories do eggs begin to break then return f as the floor.

- Write a for loop to loop through n-stories
- as it loops drop an egg
- if the egg breaks return f as the floor where eggs begin to break
- else keep dropping eggs as the stories increase

This would be O(n) becuase the time complexity would be linear as the input increases.
